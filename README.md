# spotify-access-token
Simple way to get Authorization token for a Spotify developer app.

There was a reason I made this with Vite before, but I can't remember the reason now and it's just going to be used to grab the access/refresh token from spotify for use in applications.

## How to Use
If for some reason you want to use it, you'll need to go to [Spotify's Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create an application. Find that application's Client ID and Client Secret and put that in a .env file in your project and you should be good to go.
